# Abstract
We try to identify the potential of [Google Fusion Tables](http://www.google.com/fusiontables/) to create a public WebGIS. The service should provide functionality to visualize data in different forms.
 

# Goal
The goal of this project is to create prototype applications based on Google Fusion Tables and show how use cases of current WebGIS solutions could be implemented using this alternative technology. 
The applications are either examples to show a certrain aspect or a use case with more functionality.

All examples / use cases can be found here: http://gft.rdmr.ch
