# Abstract
We try to identify the potential of [Google Fusion Tables](http://www.google.com/fusiontables/) to create a public WebGIS. The service should provide functionality to visualize data in different forms.
 

# Goal
The goal of this project is to create a prototype application based on Google Fusion Tables and show how use cases of current WebGIS solutions could be implemented using this alternative technology.
