\section{Before you start}

Dies ist der erste Unterpunkt im ersten Kapitel.

Strukturiert mit dem {\LaTeX} Systems, \emph{rubber}\footnote{https://launchpad.net/rubber/} \& \emph{latexmk}\footnote{http://www.phys.psu.edu/{\textasciitilde}collins/software/latexmk-jcc/}. 

Added for your viewing convenience is a continuous preview mode for the PDF. This mode is enabled by default, but can also be disabled through the \emph{(View $\rightarrow$ Page layout in preview)} menu. Complementary to this feature is SyncTeX integration, which allows you to synchronize the position in your editor with the PDF preview.
